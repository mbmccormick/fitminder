<p><strong>Why is this important?</strong></p>
<p>Sitting all day is bad for your health. Your risk of heart disease <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19996993">increases by nearly 64 percent</a>. Your average lifespan is reduced by <a href="http://sjp.sagepub.com/content/35/5/510.abstract">up to seven years</a>. And you have a higher risk for <a href="http://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/colorect.html">certain types of cancer</a>. The good news is your Fitbit, and Fitminder, can help you counteract this desk chair disease.</p>

<br />

<p><strong>How does Fitminder work?</strong></p>
<p>Fitminder monitors your Fitbit activity to identify periods of time when you haven't moved. If Fitminder sees that you've been sedentary for 45 minutes in the last 2 hours, we'll send you a text message to remind you to get up and move. Fitminder works best when your Fitbit is configured for all-day sync on your mobile device. The more frequently your Fitbit syncs, the better.</p>
